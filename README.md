**KPI Cards** | Total Sales, Total Cost, Total Profit, Units Sold, Average Price |
**Month-on-Month (MoM) Analysis** | Trend visuals and color-coded insights on MoM % changes |
**Geo Performance** | Visual map of sales across regional locations, clustered bar chart of Sales and Profit by Region |
**Average Price Across States** | A matrix showing the average prices across states |
**Product Performance** | A table showing performance across different products |
**Channel Perfomance** | A table showing performance across the different sales channels |

## DAX highlights

**The dashboard used custom DAX measures to drive its dynamic visuals and KPIs**

-- PM (Previous Month)
-- MOM (Month on Month)

-- Total Sales
Total Sales = SUM('fct_Sport Products'[_Total Sales])

-- Month on Month Sales Change
Month on Month Sales =  
VAR PrevM = CALCULATE([_T Sales], DATEADD(dim_Calendar[Date],-1,MONTH))
VAR Total = [_T Sales]
RETURN
IF(AND(Total <> 0, PrevM <> 0),
    DIVIDE(Total - PrevM, PrevM, 0),
    BLANK()
)

-- Conditional Formatting Logic
Month on Month % SaleColor = IF([_MoMSales] >= 0, "Green", "Red")
Month on Month %Sale Background Color = IF([_MoMSales] >= 0, "#E6F5EE", "#FBEAE9")
Month on Month %Sale = IF([_MoMSales] >= 0, FORMAT([_MoMSales], "#.0%") & " ↗", FORMAT([_MoMSales], "#.0%") & " ↘")

**Similar logic is applied to cost, profit, price, and units sold to create a smooth and scalable analytics framework.**
